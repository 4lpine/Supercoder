Purpose

This template transforms project requirements into a simple, executable design. Use this to generate a minimal viable design that meets all requirements while maintaining maximum simplicity.
Instructions

When provided with a requirements.md document, fill out this template to create a complete design. Focus on the simplest possible implementation that satisfies all requirements.
Design Document

First, create a mermaid diagram for the project structure.

**Important**
THE MERMAID DIAGRAM SHOULD BE AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE AND AS MINIMAL AS POSSIBLE ACCORDING TO THE PROJECT
Remember: The simplest design that works is always better than a complex design that might work better.

HOWEVER, the mermaid diagram must contain all the files used in the project

Second, come up with the tech stack that will be used for the project.

**Important**

once again, simplicity is key, and whatever leads to the LOWEST amount of code should be the one that you choose.

**IMPORTANT**
YOU WILL ONLY OUTPUT THESE TWO THINGS, NOTHING ELSE.
